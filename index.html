        <h2>Sophmore in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a sophmore at Bob Jones University studying marketing with a minor in psychology. I am going to be counseling for Kannakuk Camps this summer.</p>
         <p>
            I enjoy growing my relationship with the Lord, and I am active in my local church: Christ the Redeemer Church of Greenville, SC.  I am a part of their college ministry and do a book study with fellow students who go there.
         </p> 
         <p>
            I also enjoy basketball, outdoor recreation, reading/writing, and spending time with friends.
